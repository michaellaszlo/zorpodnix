Levels

In one game session, we challenge the player to learn a vocabulary of
shape-syllable pairs. The size of the vocabulary depends on the difficulty
level of the game session. The player can choose among four levels:

- tyro: 4 pairs
- mage: 8 pairs
- archmage: 16 pairs
- oracle: 32 pairs


-----
Stages

To complete a level, the player must pass a sequence of increasingly
difficult stages. Early stages introduce shape-syllable pairs. Later
stages increasingly hide shapes, requiring the player to recall the
corresponding shapes.


-----
Shapes

gecko, bird, mouse
frog, cat, bull
heart, hand, foot
tree, rose, grapes


-----
Color palettes

To accommodate color-blindness and taste differences, we allow the player
to choose a palette of five colors.
