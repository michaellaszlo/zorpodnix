In one game session, we challenge the player to learn a vocabulary of
shape-syllable pairs. The size of the vocabulary depends on the difficulty
setting of the game session. The player can choose among four settings:

- tyro: 4 pairs
- mage: 8 pairs
- archmage: 16 pairs
- oracle: 32 pairs


-----
Shape ideas

snake, lizard, bird, mouse, frog, cat, bull
cloud, lightning, tree, rose, grapes


-----
Color palettes

To accommodate color-blindness and taste differences, we allow the player
to choose a palette of five colors.
